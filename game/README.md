# Tanks Lite
I wanted a mini-game that I could use to experiment with artificial intelligence algorithms. My Fianc√©e is very passionate about the history of tanks, so I decided to make a simple 2D tank game to work from.
Tanks Lite is a 2D tank mini-game developed using p5.js. The game features two teams of tanks on a battlefield, each controlled by human players or an AIs trained using TensorFlow.
## Tank Features
The game provides different tanks with different features such as:
- HP: Different tanks have different amounts of HP. A Tank loses HP by getting shot and if it reaches 0 HP, the tank is destroyed.
- Top speed: This parameter determines how fast a tank moves at top speed.
- Acceleration: This parameter determines how fast a tank reaches top speed when starting to move.
- Traverse speed: Determines how fast the tank can rotate its turret or hull.
- Accurace: Determines the precision and accuracy of a tank's shots.
- Shell strength: Determines how much damage a tank's shot can inflict on the opposing tank.
- Shell speed: Determines how fast a tank's shot travels towards the target.
- Armor: Determines how likely a tank is to resist damage from incoming shots.
