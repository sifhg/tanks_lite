# Battleground Builder
## Introduction
**Battleground Builder** is a desktop application designed as a level designer for a 2D game called **Tanks Lite**. This app allows users to drop in assets into a CAD-like preview window where they can manipulate the instances of the assets to create a level. Users can scale, rotate, and move the instances around on the map. The app can save the level to a file that can be read by the game. This project serves as a practice for future development of a game engine.

I'm particularly grateful for the [**react-konva**](https://konvajs.org/docs/react/Intro.html) library, which has simplified the preview-window making it easier to work with asset instance manipulation.
## Why Battleground Builder?
I would like to build a game engine some dat, and this project helps me gain experience with some of the key areas of that path. These are areas such as:

- **User Interface Design**: Utilizing React to create a CAD software interface.
- **Desktop Application Development**: Leveraging Electron to build a cross-platform desktop application.
- **Asset Management**: Implementing efficient ways to manage and manipulate game assets.
## Features
- Drop in assets to a CAD-like preview window.
- Manipulate instances of assets (scale, rotate, move).
- Save levels to files compatible with **Tanks Lite**.
